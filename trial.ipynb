        "**1. How did you group flights?**  \n",
        "Flights were grouped by **route type** (Short-haul, Mid-haul A, Mid-haul B, Long-haul, Unknown) and **time of day** (AM, PM). Route type comes from the schedule’s HAUL and ARRIVAL_REGION; time band from TIME_OF_DAY (Morning/Lunchtime → AM, Afternoon/Evening → PM). This gives a clear, repeatable way to assign any flight to one of the rows in the lookup table.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Why did you choose this grouping?**  \n",
        "This method separates flights that have different **passenger mixes**: short European routes (more leisure, lower premium share) vs North American and long-haul routes (more business and loyalty). Adding AM/PM captures that morning departures often have a different mix than afternoon/evening (e.g. more business and connecting pax later in the day). The result is a table that is easy for planning to use—only route type and AM/PM are needed—and that stays stable as schedules change, without needing flight numbers or aircraft types.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. What assumptions did you make?**  \n",
        "(i) **Route type drives eligibility:** Short-haul is assumed to have the lowest Tier 1/2/3 %; long-haul and Mid-haul B the highest. (ii) **PM generally higher than AM** for the same route type, due to business and premium demand later in the day. (iii) **Unknown** is treated with conservative, short-haul-like percentages. (iv) **Tier 1** is hypothetical for T3. (v) Percentages apply at the **grouping level**, not per flight, so the table stays simple and auditable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. How can this be applied to future schedules?**  \n",
        "For each flight in a future schedule, assign **route type** (from haul and destination region) and **AM or PM** (from departure time). Read the Tier 1 %, Tier 2 %, and Tier 3 % for that grouping from the table. Multiply (passengers or seats × load factor) by each Tier % to get lounge-eligible passengers per tier per flight; sum across flights for daily or peak-period demand by tier."
